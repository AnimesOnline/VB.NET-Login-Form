# VB.NET Login Form

Currently built for MyBB but can be used for ANY forum software or anything, you just have to know the encrpytion method for the software. Just modify userpass_get.php to setup for your software. Add a HWID table with the values of VARCHAR 255 for the HWID function to work. Usercheck is for MyBB's groups, feel free to remove this if you don't want it. Have fun. I'm not giving any support for this.
